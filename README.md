# Ceaser-Cipher
A Java and Python based program that shift letters in a message by a certain shift values

Uses a basic java scanner tool to get the message that neeeds to be shifted and the shift value for the message.

Uses the ASCII table to shift letters in alphabet
(Only works for letters for now, does not work for numbers or symbols)

After shifting values output method spaces out the message into 5 words per block and 10 blocks per line to make it difficult to understand the message.

Python version also supports a basic decoder option that will decode the message but not add any spaces to the word.
